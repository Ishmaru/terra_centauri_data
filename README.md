## Story
In a lonely planet circulating a distant star, a war of survival rages on. There a sentient race, the Valkyries struggle to protect their world and themselves against the parasitic organisms Devourers. Explore large maps for resources, treasure, and other advantages to fight back the relentless horde of Devourers.

## Valkyries
![Terra](http://krazykeetgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ZO_Screen8_byAD-copy.jpg)

Artificially created by god like beings, known as the ORIGINATORS, as slaves. A handful survived the cataclysm that caused the disappearance of ORIGINATORS. Since then, they inherited the knowledge of their creators and repopulated the world. Valkyries remain fiercely loyal to their creators, worshiping them as deities. They valiantly fight to protect their world against the Devourers in hopes they 
will return.

Valkyries are very resource dependent, lots of base defenses, and use of vehicles and technologically advanced weapons.
Valkyries depend on Crystals for currency and Energy, and Ore for building materials. Many units and structures depend on energy generated by a Energy Core.

## Devourers

Its unknown where they originated from, but its believed they travel from world to world by meteors. They can survive in the most hostile environments. Devourers come in numerous forms but are actually one single species. There are a few Valkyrian researchers who even suggest that the Devourer 
individuals may actually be "organs" of one single massive organism. However that is a topic that is currently debated. 

Devourers, are cheap + fast to produce, yet are quite strong. Require only organic matter as a resource. Organic matter is obtained from consuming trees, animals and even Valkyries. More focus on Offensive melee units.

## Git Hub Version
#### This is NOT a ready to play version of the game.

I will only be hosting Terra specific files on git hub. In order to play, You will still need a __separate copy__ of the Megaglest Engine (Only the engine not the game data) and install Terra files inside that directory. __DO NOT INSTALL TERRA TO YOUR MAIN MEGAGLEST(GAME) DIRECTORY, AS THIS WILL OVERWRITE IMPORTANT FILES!__

__Megaglest V 3.9.1 is recomended.__

Terra Requires the Megaglest engine which can be found at: 
https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-source/releases/tag/3.9.1

## Patreon
Terra started as a croudfunded game, with the idea that people can contribute toward each release. However due to time constraints, and lack of funding, I've stopped collecting donations at this time.
__Patreon fundraising for Terra Centauri, has ended.__

Thank to all who contributed, for their Support!
